# Assignment 1

###### In this assignment, we used the basic syntax in JavaScript to build some functions.

## Tasks
>There were 2 tasks in this assignment:

**1) To create a playNumbers function**
- This function takes infinite arguments
- If there are no arguments passed, the function displays a message and proram terminates
- If one or more argumnents passed to the function is not a number, it displays those parameters with a message
- If the above steps are not reached, it displays the largest number among the parameters passed
- Then, it displays the average ofall the parameter values

**2) To create a celsius and fahrenheit converter**
- This function takes 2 parameters (value, CF)
- This function does not return anything if the value is not a number, the value is not either 'C' or 'F'
- If the CF is 'C', that means that the passed value is in celsius and needs to be converted into fahrenheit
- If the CF is 'F', that means that the passed value is in fahrenheit and needs to be converted into celsius
